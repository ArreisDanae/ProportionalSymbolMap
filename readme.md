### Application Purpose
My application gives a visual to the _Center for Disease Control and Prevention's_ published dataset on Motor Vehicle Occupant Death Rates from 2012.

### Data
The data used included all ages, both male and female. Fatality rates based on fewer than 20 deaths were suppressed. The minimum death rate was recorded in New York at 3. The maximum death rate was recorded in North Dakota at 20.

### Symbolization and Design
The data was symoblized through a proportional symbol map; the circle symbols vary in size to represent a quantitative variable. The color of the circle symbols is orange. The leaflet basemap 'Stamen_TonerLite' was used so that state boundaries were clearly visable.
